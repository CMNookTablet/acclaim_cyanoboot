How to update u-boot boot logo
------------------------------

Replace o_nookcolor_logo_large.bmp with the new logo. 

This logo should be a 1024 wide and 600 pixel high 32-bit RGB colorspace Windows bitmap file.
For proper orientation the 'bottom' (side where the Home/n button) is the right edge of the image.

Once the image has been replace issue the following commands in tools/logos

make clean; make; make install

after this do a clean rebuild of u-boot.
